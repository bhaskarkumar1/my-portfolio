          Hi Everyone, I am Bhaskar Kumar from Bihar, India. I am a Final year
          pursuing B.tech in Electronics and Communication.
        </h3>
        I'm a self-taught Front End developer from India. I build websites with
        a focus on providing the experience for everyone using them and
        responsiveness. Curious to learn more about developing scalable
        distribution systems, love problem solving, and care about writing and
        maintainable code. A responsive design makes your website accessible to
        all users, regardless of their devices.
        <br></br>

        Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
        <li>Fitness-freak</li>
        <li>Playing chess</li>
        <li>Travelling</li>
